Villa Cariso, designed and decorated by a leading Greek architect, is the perfect destination for (up to) 10 vacationers looking to experience Greece in its full beauty. With 5 bedrooms, each with its own bathroom and shower, a private pool, a fully-equipped kitchen, a fully-fenced garden and expansive courtyard, a Weber gas BBQ, and Wi-Fi everywhere, inside and outside within the property, you’ll have everything needed to make the most of your trip. 

The villa includes 5 spacious bedrooms, each one with its private bathroom (shower/toilet) and outfitted in a specific theme. Explore the comfort of each bedroom and enjoy your stay in modern comforts with personal touches.

- Top level: The Vintage Soul master bedroom evokes the touches of a bygone era. It has a traditional king-size bed with individually adjustable mattresses to personalize your comfort. In the Blue Sea bedroom, two single beds can be easily reconfigured into a double bed. The two bedrooms share a 12 sq-m (130 sq-ft) open-air, sea-facing balcony with jaw-dropping view. Lounge in comfort under the provided umbrella and enjoy sunrise or sunset with a glass of wine or a complimentary shot of our own Limoncello, prepared from local lemons renowned for their fragrance.

- Main level: From the front gate of the property, walk up a few steps surrounded by fragrances from luscious plants. The main level is comprised of an open-concept kitchen with adjoining dining room, guest WC, and a comfortable living room with a wood-burning fireplace and a large flat-screen smart TV. Alternatively, have ouzo and fresh fish at the outside table on the large covered open-air sea-facing balcony.

- Pool level: The Autumn Leaves and the Seagulls bedrooms both have double beds, which can be separated into single beds, as your needs dictate. The two bedrooms open to the large courtyard and pool via French doors. Further inside, the Boat Cabin has a roomy bunk bed for the sailors in your party. In the spacious courtyard, an oversized table that seats twelve diners comfortably, an outdoor bar, wicker furniture and comfortable lounge chairs and small tables are there for the enjoyment of your food and beverage poolside. 

The kitchen is fully-stocked with modern cooking appliances, making it hassle-free to whip up a home cooked feast. Enjoy indoor dining around the table or take the party outdoors, celebrating the sights of the sea, islands, and town. Take to the outdoor lounge, dangle your legs in the pool and enjoy the mouth-watering aroma coming from the provided grill. Soak up the sun on an outdoor recliner and plan your next Vespa ride through the hills, collecting sights, fragrances, and views.
