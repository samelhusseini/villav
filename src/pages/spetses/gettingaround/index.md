### Busses

There are 2 'bus lines' on the island, the difference being that they depart from two different points in the town and that they have two different drivers. 

The first bus departs from the town beach, named Ayios Mamas and travels in a south-easterly direction, with its final destination being Ayia Paraskevi, the beach on the southern side of the island. 
The other bus departs from the Poseidonion jetty and travels in a south-westerly direction, with its final destination being Vrelos Beach on the south-west of the island. 
They both stop at other beaches on route: 
- The Ayios Mamas stop bus stops at Ayia Marina; Kouzounos; Xilokersiza; Ayia Anargyri and then Ayia Paraskevi. 
- The Poseidonion jetty stop bus stops at Kaiki Beach; Ligoneri and then Vrelos. 

Passengers usually buy a round trip ticket, although passengers stopping at Ayia Anargyri or Ayia Paraskevi may buy a one way ticket and then decide to take the boat back for a different experience. 
All times should be checked in advance. 
Times are on boards at both stops and buses usually start in May and end in September/October depending on passenger volume.



### Caiques/Kaiki's

Caiques are traditionally small, wooden fishing boats. They have, over the past couple of decades, been used to transport tourists from place to place. Spetses, being famous for its boat building,is not short of Caiques, and the larger ones are used to take holiday makers to the beaches each day. These boats are moored at the main jetty, called 'Dapia' and they have signs on them advertising their beach destination. Most go to Ayia Anargyri and Ayia Paraskevi, Zogheria beach and across to the mainland to the port and beach of Kosta.

They usually work in strict rotation. When the first boat fills up, they will head for the beach (approximately 10.30am) and then the next one will fill up and so on. The last one usually leaves between 12.30 - 1pm. You have to return on the boat that you travelled on in the morning. The first boat to leave in the morning will be the first boat to leave the beach and then so on. (Boats depart beaches from between 4 - 6pm). The boatman will tell you what time they will depart in the afternoon, when you pay for your ticket on the outward journey. They have fixed prices. Prices are €3 each way to Kosta and €8 with return to Anargyri/Ayia Paraskevi.

### Cab / Taxi

Spetses does not yet have access to ride share services, but there are a few taxis in operation on the island. Here are a couple taxi companies that we recommend:

Taxi: 	***-***-****

They are usually waiting in the harbour, parked near the horse buggies or on the jetty. You can book a taxi to meet you off the flying dolphin (or however you arrive). Usually in high season, they have already been booked for arrivals. However, if they are booked, they will point you in the direction of another one or they will arrange to come back and pick you and your luggage up.


### Horse Buggies

Horse buggies are a very traditional mode of transport on Spetses. They are not something you will find on many other Greek islands. They are usually favoured for short trips, e.g going on a sightseeing trip of the old harbour (Palio Limani) from the Dapia harbour or getting to some of the nearer beaches.
They will also transport you to and from your accommodation, but will have a limit on the number of passengers and the weight of the luggage.
They can be pre-booked or potential passengers can just hail one and jump in. There is a price list in Dapia where they have their 'horse stop' and like the bus, they also have another 'horse stop' on the Poseidonion jetty, to service the west side of the island.
Check prices before you jump in.

### Motorbike Hire



### Water Taxis

Water Taxis are available all day and all night. They can be found moored right in Dapia harbour and also at Kosta on the mainland, as a way of getting to the island. There is a price list by the steps and they work in rotation i.e taking the nearest one moored, first. They can also be pre-booked and there is a list of telephone numbers by the price list. You may also be able to negotiate a special price on one of the larger water taxis for a group of passengers wishing to have a round trip day out. They operate to anywhere on the island (beach wise) and will also go to anywhere along the edge of the mainland, opposite Spetses. They are also very popular for whisking people back and forth to the old harbour late at night.
